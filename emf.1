Documentation for the emf program.

This program runs EM with a d-dimensional gaussian mixture model,
with full covariance matrices, and mutable mixing ratios.

Usage: emf epochs data clusters [labels [data n]].

where:	epochs is the number of iterations of EM to run,
	data is the file of data to read, consisting of N
		d-dimensional points.
	clusters is the file of initial values for the mixture model
	labels (optional) is a file to write the probabilities of the
		datapoints to following the final EM iteration
	data (optional) is a file of data to read the datapoints whose
		probabilities are to be written to (optional)
	n (optional) is the number of points in that second data file

At the end of the run, the final state of the mixture model is written
to standard output.

To change the dimensionality (D), the number of gaussians in the
mixture (K), or number of points in the dataset EM is used on (D), you
have to recompile the program, thus:

	gcc -DD=xxx -DK=xxx -DN=xxx -O2 -s -o emf emf.c

By default full covariance matrices are used, if you want diagonal
ones instead add a -DDIAGONAL to the compilation.

All data and initialization files can contain comments, which consist
of a ; to the end of the line.  Such a file looks something like this:

	; 121 datapoints, 2 clusters, 2-dimensional.
	; Initial sum of priors 1.
	;;; Epoch 200.
	;; Cluster 0
	; prior
	0.475973
	; mean
	 5 22.2657
	; covariance matrix
	    10 1.42109E-14
	    1.42109E-14 274.821

	;; Cluster 1
	; prior
	0.524027
	; mean
	 5 75.1909
	; covariance matrix
	    10 2.84217E-13
	    2.84217E-13 325.442

while a reasonable initialization file before EM had run might look
something like this:

	; 2 clusters, 2-dimensional.
	; init file
	;; Cluster 0
	; prior
	0.5
	; mean
	0 0
	; covariance matrix
	 1 0
	 0 1

	;; Cluster 1
	; prior
	0.5
	; mean
	2 3
	; covariance matrix
	 1 0
	 0 1

All the comments are just that, of course, so be careful.  (You can
always run emf for 0 epochs to see if it agrees with you about the
semantics of the numbers in your file.)

			  Potential Pitfalls

If the initialization file is bad obviously you can run into trouble.
Eg if some datapoint has super low probability so it underflows really
far (this could be fixed if I went to a lot of trouble), or if one
cluster is hugging just one point so EM converges to a singularity
(this problem is inherent to maximum likelihood EM).  So be careful
out there!

			 Resource Consumption

The updates are O(N K D^2 + K D^3) time, and the program uses
O(N D + K D^2) space.
